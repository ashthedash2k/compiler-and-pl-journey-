# compiler-and-pl-journey-
Bootstrapping a compiler in python. Will compile static python (I am enforcing types). Will update as I go along.<br>

# Currently implemented:
- lexing
- parsing and ast for BEDMAS
- assembly for BEDMAS

# Current Next steps
- ast for variables
- BEDMAS static ints, adding strings
